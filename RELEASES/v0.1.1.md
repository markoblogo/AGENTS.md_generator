# GitHub Release v0.1.1 — AGENTS.md Generator

Tag: `v0.1.1`  
Repo: `AGENTS.md_generator`

## What is new

- Added reusable GitHub Action: `.github/actions/agentsgen-guard`
  - Fails PRs when `AGENTS.md` / `RUNBOOK.md` are missing, invalid, or outdated
  - Uses core `check_repo` logic as source of truth
  - Supports optional PR comment mode (`comment=true`) with best-effort behavior
- Added action docs: `docs/gh-action.md`
- Added copy-paste workflow example: `.github/workflows/agentsgen-guard.example.yml`
- Updated README with a “GitHub Action: PR Guard” section and usage snippet

## Safety model updates

- Guard action never modifies repository files in CI
- PR commenting is optional and fork-safe by default
- If comment API write fails (token/permissions on fork PRs), guard logs a warning and still enforces check result

## Notes about file filtering

- `agentsgen check` currently validates repo-level state and has no native `--files` CLI flag
- Action input `files` filters reported file-specific findings while still running full core validation via `check_repo`

## Suggested workflow permissions

- Always:
  - `contents: read`
- Only when `comment: "true"`:
  - `pull-requests: write`
